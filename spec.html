<h1 style="text-align: center">Job Skill Assessment Test</h1>
<p>Thank you for interesting in our job offering. As you already know, before we hire you, we want you to take
    quick coding skills test.</p>
<p>Together with this document you got how much time you have to complete this task and what programming language to
    use.</p>
<h3>What we expect from you?</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Use OOP</li>
    <li>If you understand S.O.L.I.D. principle, please use it, that's a big plus</li>
    <li>We prefer quality over quantity, meaning: it's better to submit quality coded un-fished task than finished task
        with spaghetti code.
    </li>
    <li>Use GIT as VCS</li>
    <li>Your final code does not need to have "fancy" styled output.
        You can use console or webpage for output. Unit tests would be actually the best choice. 
        Basically, provide us simple as possible way to see your code in action.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>What we want you to build?</h3>
<p>You need to code core structure for messaging app.</p>
<p>This message app have 3 different user types: <strong>Student</strong>, <strong>Teacher</strong> and
    <strong>Parent</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Each user type should have follow:</p>
<ol>
    <li>User ID (required)</li>
    <li>First name (required)</li>
    <li>Last name (required)</li>
    <li>Email (required)</li>
    <li>Profile Photo (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p>Difference between user types:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Teachers</strong> and <strong>Parents</strong> have <strong>Salutation (optional)</strong>, it's used in full
        name.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Teacher</strong> can send message to any user type</li>
    <li><strong>Parent</strong> and <strong>Student</strong> can send message only to <strong>Teachers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After initialising user object we need to have following options:</p>
<ol>
    <li>User object need to have option to get <strong>full name</strong>.<br>
        For <strong>Students</strong> full name is combined from: <strong>first name</strong> + <strong>last
            name</strong>.<br>
        For <strong>Teachers</strong> and <strong>Parents</strong> is built from:
        <strong>salutation</strong> + <strong>first name</strong> + <strong>last name</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>We need a way to get profile picture. If we don't set profile picture on initialising user object, we need to
        have
        option to get path/url to default system avatar.
    </li>
    <li>
        Get email
    </li>
    <li>
        Get user id.
    </li>
    <li>We need option to save user. On save we need to validate <strong>email</strong> and
        <strong>profile picture</strong>.
        For <strong>profile picture</strong> as this is only test, do not make complex validation, instead check
        does passed string have <i>.jpg</i> in file name, if not <strong>save</strong> should fail.<br>
        Also, this <strong>save</strong> feature does not need to actually save user, instead it should only return
        success if validation passed, and fail if not.
    </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Each message need to have (all required):</p>
<ol>
    <li>Sender</li>
    <li>Receiver</li>
    <li>Message text</li>
    <li>Creation time (Unix time format)</li>
    <li>Message type: <strong>System</strong> or <strong>Manual</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For each message we want to have following features</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>System</strong> message can only send <strong>Teacher</strong> and only to <strong>Students</strong>.</li>
    <li>Option to get full name of sender and receiver</li>
    <li>Option to get message text</li>
    <li>Option to get message type</li>
    <li>Formatted creation time</li>
    <li>Option to <strong>save</strong> message. Same as for saving user, we don't need actual saving, 
        we just need validation.<br>
        For example, if we create new message instance and we set <strong>Student</strong> as sender,
        but we also set message type to <strong>System</strong>,
        <strong>save</strong> message should fail as <strong>Teacher</strong> can only send <strong>System</strong> messages.
    </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>How final code should look?</h3>

<p>We don't want you to implement database or some other data storage provider.</p>
<p>We want code where you/we can create new object instances and pass hard-coded data just for tests.
    If coded properly, you should be able to easily connect your code with DB.
</p>
<p>Your code should be clean and easy for read.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are looking forward to see your final code.<br>
Enjoy in coding and good luck.</p>
